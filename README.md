Categorical Latent Gaussian Process
-----------

This code assumes that there exists a clone of the Theano repository (https://github.com/Theano/Theano) in the parent folder. To clone the repo, run:
git clone https://github.com/Theano/Theano.git

To run the example file, execute:
python CLGP_theano_example.py

Note that Theano will compile the code the first time the example is run, which might take some time.
